# multi-arch
where are the docs?

https://github.com/ckulka/docker-multi-arch-example is interesting - multi-arch docker images, built entirely on docker hub

BUT - the repo uses one dockerfile per arch, and a filename that i can't find docs for... so i'm curious..

## what's the minimum to build more than one arch?

Can I just add the `hook/pre_build`, and a single Dockerfile?
